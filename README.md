Use case 
=========
1. When I am not at home I want to be sure that my home's electricity is still up because
   I have a lot of chicken in my freezer.
2. I go on <a href="health.jvnm.dev">health.jvnm.dev</a>
3. If the webpage is displayed it means that my raspberry is still up, so my home's electricity too
4. If I have a timeout, there is no electricity. I must run to save my chicken.

Conclusion: no black magic, it's just a webpage served by Nginx on a raspberry pi
